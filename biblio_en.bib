    abstract={In this paper, a two-dimensional anti-jamming communication scheme for cognitive radio networks is developed, in which a secondary user (SU) exploits both spread spectrum and user mobility to address jamming attacks, while not interfering with primary users. By applying a deep Q-network algorithm, this scheme determines whether to recommend that the SU leave an area of heavy jamming and chooses a frequency hopping pattern to defeat smart jammers. Without knowing the jamming model and the radio channel model, the SU derives an optimal anti-jamming communication policy using Q-learning in a proposed dynamic game, and applies a deep convolution neural network to accelerate the learning speed with a large number of frequency channels. The proposed scheme can increase the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and improve the utility of the SU against cooperative jamming, compared with a Q-learning-only based benchmark system.},  keywords={cognitive radio;convolution;game theory;jamming;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radio networks;spread spectrum communication;telecommunication computing;2D antijamming communication;deep reinforcement learning;cognitive radio networks;spread spectrum;user mobility;jamming attacks;deep Q-network algorithm;frequency hopping pattern;Q-learning;dynamic game;deep convolution neural network;frequency channels;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;cooperative jamming;Jamming;Games;Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Spread spectrum communication;Learning (artificial intelligence);Cognitive radio networks;jamming;deep reinforcement learning;game theory;deep Q-networks},  doi={10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952524},  ISSN={2379-190X},  month={March},}

  abstract={We introduce Competing Mobile Network Game (CMNG), a stochastic game played by cognitive radio networks that compete for dominating an open spectrum access. Differentiated from existing approaches, we incorporate both communicator and jamming nodes to form a network for friendly coalition, integrate antijamming and jamming subgames into a stochastic framework, and apply Q-learning techniques to solve for an optimal channel access strategy. We empirically evaluate our Q-learning based strategies and find that Minimax-Q learning is more suitable for an aggressive environment than Nash-Q while Friend-or-foe Q-learning can provide the best solution under distributed mobile ad hoc networking scenarios in which the centralized control can hardly be available.},
